At the age of 16 (in 2013) I began developing simple games using the Unity game engine.
During my university years, I worked on various freelance projects, including some international projects. 

Since November 2020, I have been employed full-time as a mobile gamedeveloper using Unity.

Additionally, I have developed XR/AR applications for mobile phones and PCs (with Kinect Sensor).
